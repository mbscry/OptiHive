Given:
- A set of vehicles, each having a unique start location ("start_point"). Each vehicle can travel from its start location and must return to its own start location. A vehicle may also remain unused (i.e., it does not move).
- A set of target nodes ("goal_point"). Each target node must be visited exactly once by exactly one vehicle.
- A vehicle specific maximum distance (if any) that each vehicle can travel.
- All positions (start points, goal points) are given as 2D coordinates in Euclidean space.

Task:
- For each vehicle, find a closed path (starting and ending at its own start point), such that:
    - Each goal point is visited exactly once by exactly one vehicle.
    - A vehicle may be unused (in which case its path remains at its start point).
    - The total distance travel by any vehicle must not exceed the its maximum distance.
- The overall objective is to minimize the sum of Euclidean distances traveled by all vehicles.

Additional Details:
- The path of each vehicle is a sequence of locations.
- The problem is INFEASIBLE if and only if at least one goal is unreachable while strictly respecting the maximum distance rule.
