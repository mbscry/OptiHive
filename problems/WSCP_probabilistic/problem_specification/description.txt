Given:
- A set of emitters defined by:
  • a non-negative cost,
  • a two-dimensional position (x, y),
  • a positive coverage radius,
  • a probability of failure, at most equal to 0.2.
- A set of clients defined by:
  • a two-dimensional position (x, y),
  • a minimum required probability of coverage, at most equal to 0.99.
- A client is considered covered by an emitter if the emitter is active and if the straight-line distance between the client and the emitter is less than or equal to the emitter’s coverage radius.
- An emitter is either selected or not selected. Only selected emitters can cover clients.

Task:
- Select a subset of emitters such that the total cost of the selected emitters is minimum.
- The selected emitters must be chosen in a way that every client is covered with sufficient probability.

Additional Details:
- A client may be covered by more than one emitter.
- The failures of emitters happen independently.
- A client is considered covered as long as at least one of the selected and active emitters lies within its coverage radius.
- The solution is feasible if only if all clients are covered with sufficient probability.
