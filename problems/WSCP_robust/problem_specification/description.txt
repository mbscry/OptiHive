Given:
- A set of emitters defined by:
  • a non-negative cost,
  • a two-dimensional position (x, y),
  • a positive coverage radius.
- A set of clients. Each client has a two-dimensional position (x, y).
- A client is considered covered by an emitter if the straight-line distance between the client and the emitter is less than or equal to the emitter’s coverage radius.
- An integer K, greater than or equal to 0, representing the number of emitters that may be deactivated by an adversary.
- An emitter is either selected or not selected. Only selected emitters can cover clients.
- The adversary can later observe the selected emitters and is allowed to deactivate any K of them.
- After the adversary deactivates K selected emitters, the remaining active emitters must collectively cover all clients.

Task:
- Select a subset of emitters such that the total cost of the selected emitters is minimum.
- The selected emitters must be chosen in a way that, for every possible way the adversary might deactivate exactly K of the selected emitters, the remaining emitters still cover all clients.

Additional Details:
- A client may be covered by more than one emitter.
- A client is considered covered as long as at least one of the selected and active emitters lies within its coverage radius.
- The solution is feasible if only if all clients remain covered after any possible combination of K deactivations.
